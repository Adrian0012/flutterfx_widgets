# Flutterfx Widget Showcase [WIP]


We're on a mission here. The flutterfx project is all about showing how easy it is to create stunning visuals in Flutter. Let's flood the app stores with gorgeous, eye-catching designs!

Each animation is implemented as a separate widget, making it easy to understand and integrate into your own projects.
