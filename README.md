# Flutterfx Widget Showcase [WIP]


We're on a mission here. The flutterfx project is all about showing how easy it is to create stunning visuals in Flutter. Let's flood the app stores with gorgeous, eye-catching designs!

Each animation is implemented as a separate widget, making it easy to understand and integrate into your own projects.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Effect</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
    <th width="30%">Preview</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Folder</strong></td>
    <td>
      A nice looking folder animation with a shine built using <code>AnimationController</code> and <code>Transform</code>. 
      Demonstrates the usage of Flutter's transform apis.

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bookshelf</strong></td>
    <td>
      A 3d looking book shelf built using <code>AnimatedBuilder</code> and <code>Transform</code>.
